# Stopwatch

For a quick intro, see my brief overview on the <a href="https://github.com/kiarazhu/Seven-Segment-Display"> Seven Segment Display </a>.

## The Goal

To make the stopwatch, I will be using the ATmega324A microcontroller. The stopwatch will count up and have two digits illuminated to represent the time elapsed in seconds:
- The ones and tenths place, along with the decimal point, will be illuminated when counting from 0.0-9.9s. The display will increment every 0.1s.
- The tens and ones place will be illuminated when counting from 10-99s. The display will update every 1s.
